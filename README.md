# Python Daily Drills

This is my Python trainer.

It's built around 4 essential pillars:

Pillar 1 — Fluency & Logic (Grammar of Python)
	•	Goal: Think in Python without stumbling on syntax.
	•	What it covers: Core data types, loops, functions, comprehensions, error handling, I/O basics.

⸻

Pillar 2 — Algorithms & Problem Solving (Sharpening the Mind)
	•	Goal: Learn to break down problems into steps and solve them systematically.
	•	What it covers: Sorting, searching, string/array challenges, recursion, basic data structures (stacks, queues, hashmaps).

⸻

Pillar 3 — Scripting & Automation (Practical Engineering Tools)
	•	Goal: Use Python to do real work with files, APIs, and data.
	•	What it covers:
	•	File parsing (CSV, JSON, YAML, Parquet).
	•	CLI tools with argparse.
	•	Logging, error handling, testing.
	•	Connecting to databases and APIs.

Pillar 4 — Projects & Systems (Portfolio & Proof)
	•	Goal: Build end-to-end systems.
	•	What it covers:
	•	Full ETL/ELT pipelines.
	•	Scheduling (cron, Airflow-like).
