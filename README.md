# Python Daily Drills

> Daily hands-on Python practice focused on fluency, fundamentals, and readiness for data engineering roles.

This repository documents my structured Python practice as part of my preparation for a career in **data engineering**. Each script is a self-contained exercise designed to reinforce foundational Python skills and essential tools used in data workflows.

---

## Objectives

- Build confidence writing clean, correct Python code from scratch
- Strengthen core programming concepts (variables, loops, functions, etc.)
- Practice real-world data engineering patterns (file handling, data parsing, logging, etc.)
- Develop daily coding discipline through small, focused challenges
- Prepare for technical interviews and professional project development

---

## Repository Structure


Each script is named and dated to reflect the topic and order of practice.

---

## Practice Approach

- **Frequency**: Daily (15–30 minutes per session)
- **Format**: One self-contained script per day
- **Tools**: Plain Python (no libraries unless necessary)
- **Reference**: _Python Crash Course_, 2nd Edition by Eric Matthes

---

## Progress Tracking

Use the `skills_checklist.md` file to track which skills have been completed and mastered.

Focus begins with **core Python**, then gradually expands into practical scripting for data workflows—working with files, JSON, timestamps, and basic automation.

---

## Sample Skills Covered

- Variables and data types  
- Control flow (if/else, loops)  
- Functions and modular code  
- Lists and dictionaries  
- File I/O (text, CSV)  
- Error handling  
- Working with paths, strings, and timestamps  
- Structured logging  
- CLI arguments and script automation

## Why This Repository?

Fluency in Python is foundational to effective data engineering. This repository documents my journey toward becoming confident in using Python as a daily tool—not just for academic exercises, but for solving real-world problems.
