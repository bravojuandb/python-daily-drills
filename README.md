# Python Daily Drills


## What is this

This repo is my Python trainer - preparing me for high-quality coding interviews like Turing. 
It's built around 4 essential pillars of professional Python development:

- 1. Fluency & Logic
Think and code quickly and correctly using Python’s built-in features (lists, dicts, sets, loops).
Turing coding tests are timed. Solving problems fast and cleanly is a must.

- 2. Clean Code & Testing
Write reusable, testable functions, use docstrings, handle edge cases, and write pytest tests.
Turing favors production-quality code. Employers want clean, maintainable scripts.

- 3. Script Engineering
Build full scripts with argparse, logging, file I/O, and modular design (main()).
Many tasks involve building and running pipelines or utilities — not just functions.

- 4. Pipeline Thinking
You simulate real-world data workflows: read a file → transform it → write it — and organize code well.
Data engineering is all about flow. Can I think in terms of ETL or DAG stages?


## Methodology

- In each Python study seesion, make as many timed drills as I can.

- Chatgpt prompt:

            “Give me a Turing-style Python drill from Pillar X, Level Y.”

            being X the pillar number, and Y the diggiculty: easy, medium or hard
