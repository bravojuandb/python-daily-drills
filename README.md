# Python Daily Drills

## What is this?

This is my Python trainer for high-quality coding interviews.
It's built around 4 essential pillars:

- Fluency & Logic:
     
Think and code quickly and correctly using Python’s built-in features (lists, dicts, sets, loops).

- Clean Code & Testing:
     
Write reusable, testable functions, use docstrings, handle edge cases, and write pytest tests.

- Script Engineering:
     
Build full scripts with argparse, logging, file I/O, and modular design (main()).

- Pipeline Thinking:
     
Simulate real-world data workflows: read a file → transform it → write it — and organize code well.

## Methodology

- In each Python study seesion, make as many timed drills as I can.

- Chatgpt prompt:

            “Give me a Turing-style Python drill from Pillar X, Level Y.”

            being X the pillar number, and Y the difficulty: easy, medium or hard
