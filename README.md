# Python Daily Drills for Data Engineering

This is my personal training ground to cultivate the core skills required for Data Engineering.
This path is structured progressively around four pillars, designed to evolve from Python fluency to system thinking.


## Pillar 1 — Fluency & Logic (Grammar of Python)
- **Goal:** Think in Python without stumbling on syntax.  
- **What it covers:** Core data types, loops, functions, comprehensions, error handling, I/O basics.  
- [Contents](pillar1/README.md)


## Pillar 2 — Data Structures & Problem Solving
- **Goal:** Develop algorithmic thinking while manipulating real data collections.  
- **What it covers:** Sorting, searching, aggregating, recursion, and data-structure patterns (lists, dicts, sets, stacks, queues).  
- [Contents](pillar2/README.md)


## Pillar 3 — Scripting & Automation 
- **Goal:** Use Python to do real work with files, APIs, and data.  
- **What it covers:**  
  - File parsing (CSV, JSON, YAML, Parquet)  
  - CLI tools with `argparse`  
  - Logging, error handling, testing  
  - Connecting to databases and APIs  
- [Contents](pillar3/README.md)


## Pillar 4 — Project-like drills & System
- **Goal:** end-to-end systems.  
- **What it covers:**  
*A series of project-like drills leading to:*
  - Full ETL/ELT pipelines  
  - Scheduling (cron, Airflow-like)  
  - Data quality checks  
  - Cloud storage and orchestration  
  - Documentation, GitHub repos, CI/CD
