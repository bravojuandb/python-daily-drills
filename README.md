# Python Daily Drills

This is my Python trainer, a series of drills organized around four pillars.  
Instead of standing separately, these pillars are built like concentric layers, each reinforcing the other.  

Each pillar is composed of atomic exercises, organized into subcategories (one commit per exercise, one issue per subcategory).  

**4 essential pillars**:

---

## Pillar 1 — Fluency & Logic (Grammar of Python)
- **Goal:** Think in Python without stumbling on syntax.  
- **What it covers:** Core data types, loops, functions, comprehensions, error handling, I/O basics.  
- [Contents](pillar1/README.md)

---

## Pillar 2 — Data Structures & Problem Solving (Bridging Logic and Data)
- **Goal:** Develop algorithmic thinking while manipulating real data collections.  
- **What it covers:** Sorting, searching, aggregating, recursion, and data-structure patterns (lists, dicts, sets, stacks, queues).  
- [Contents](pillar2/README.md)

---

## Pillar 3 — Scripting & Automation (Practical Engineering Tools)
- **Goal:** Use Python to do real work with files, APIs, and data.  
- **What it covers:**  
  - File parsing (CSV, JSON, YAML, Parquet)  
  - CLI tools with `argparse`  
  - Logging, error handling, testing  
  - Connecting to databases and APIs  

---

## Pillar 4 — Projects & Systems (Portfolio & Proof)
- **Goal:** Build end-to-end systems.  
- **What it covers:**  
  - Full ETL/ELT pipelines  
  - Scheduling (cron, Airflow-like)  
  - Data quality checks  
  - Cloud storage and orchestration  
  - Documentation, GitHub repos, CI/CD
