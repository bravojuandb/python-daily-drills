# Python Daily Drills 

A collection of exercises focused on Python *as a tool for Data Engineering*.

This learning system is structured progressively around four pillars, from the very basics of Pyhton (pillar 1) to more advanced topics like Python for data pipelines.

A short sentence that motivates me:

> “Καὶ τὰ μικρὰ μεγάλα ἔσται, ἐὰν ἐπιμονῇ κρατῇς.”  
> *Even small things become great if you persist.* — *Demosthenes*  


## Pillar 1 — Fluency & Logic
Think in Python without stumbling on syntax.  
- **What it covers:** Core data types, loops, functions, comprehensions, error handling, I/O basics.  
- [Contents](pillar1/README.md)


## Pillar 2 — Data Structures & Problem Solving
Develop algorithmic thinking while manipulating real data collections.  
- **What it covers:** Sorting, searching, aggregating, recursion, and data-structure patterns (lists, dicts, sets, stacks, queues).  
- [Contents](pillar2/README.md)


## Pillar 3 — Scripting & Automation 
Use Python to do real work with files, APIs, and data.  
- **What it covers:**  
  - Pandas as a tool  
  - File parsing (CSV, JSON, YAML, Parquet)  
  - CLI tools with `argparse`  
  - Logging, error handling, testing  
  - Connecting to databases and APIs  
- [Contents](pillar3/README.md)


## Pillar 4 — Project-like drills & System
End-to-end pipeline-like systems.  
- **What it covers:**  
  - Full ETL/ELT pipelines  
  - Scheduling (cron, Airflow-like)  
  - Data quality checks  
  - Cloud storage and orchestration  
  - Documentation, GitHub repos, CI/CD
