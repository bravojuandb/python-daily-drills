Problem: Binary Search Implementation

You are given a sorted list of integers `nums` and a target value `x`.  
Write a function `binary_search(nums, x)` that returns the **index** of `x` in `nums`,  
or `-1` if `x` is not found.

Rules:
- Use a `while low <= high` loop (no recursion).
- Update `low` and `high` correctly depending on comparisons.
- Midpoint formula: `mid = (low + high) // 2`
- Do NOT use `in`, `.index()`, or any helper libraries.

Example:
    Input:
        nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
        x = 7
    Output:
        3

Be quick and precise â€” off-by-one errors lurk everywhere in binary search.

    """
    Principles:
    1. If x is in the array it is within the closest interval [low, high]
    2. Binary search works only in sorted data in ascendin order.
    2. Compute mid, compare, discard half, repeat
