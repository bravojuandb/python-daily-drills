"""
Problem: Aggregating Totals

You are given a list of (category, amount) pairs, like sales transactions.  
Write a function `aggregate_totals(data)` that returns a dictionary  
where each category key has the total sum of all its amounts.

Rules:
- Use a loop or comprehension with `sum()`.
- Do not use pandas or external libs.
- Group by the category key efficiently.

Example:
    Input:
        [
            ("fruit", 10),
            ("vegetable", 5),
            ("fruit", 4),
            ("dairy", 6),
            ("fruit", 1)
        ]
    Output:
        {"fruit": 15, "vegetable": 5, "dairy": 6}

Hint:
- You may use a dictionary accumulation pattern like:
      totals[key] = totals.get(key, 0) + value

Be quick and precise â€” this logic powers aggregations, metrics, and rollups in ETL pipelines.
