Unique Visitors Counter challenge

Given a web server log file `access.log`, each line containing an IP address
(e.g. "192.168.0.5"), implement a function that returns the number of **unique**
visitors.

Rules:
- Read the log line by line from the file path provided.
- Ignore blank lines.
- Treat the same IP appearing multiple times as one visitor.
- You may assume one IP per line.
- Use a set for O(1) membership testing.

Signature:
    def count_unique_visitors(filepath: str) -> int:

Example:
    # access.log
    # 192.168.0.5
    # 192.168.0.6
    # 192.168.0.5
    # Expected: 2

Think fast, code cleanly â€” this logic is the foundation for
log deduplication and unique-user analytics in pipelines.
