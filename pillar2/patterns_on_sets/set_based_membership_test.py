"""
ğŸš€ Challenge â€” Set-Based Membership Speed Test

You are analyzing two collections:

    users_list = list(range(1_000_000))
    users_set  = set(users_list)

Write a short script that measures and compares **lookup speed** when checking if
the number `999_999` is present in both the list and the set.

Requirements:
1. Use the `time` or `%timeit` approach to measure the duration of `999_999 in users_list`
   versus `999_999 in users_set`.
2. Print or log both timings clearly.
3. Explain (in a single print statement) *why* the set lookup is faster.

ğŸ’¡ Be quick and precise â€” focus on *time complexity*, not syntax tricks.
