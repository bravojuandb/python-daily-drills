**Print Formatting Challenge**

Youâ€™re given three variables:
name = "Alice"
age = 29
balance = 1345.6789

Write ONE print statement using an f-string that produces this exact output:

Customer: Alice | Age: 29 | Balance: â‚¬1,345.68

ðŸ’¡ Requirements:
- Use f-string formatting (not concatenation)
- Round balance to two decimals
- Include the euro sign (â‚¬) and thousand separator (,)

Be quick â€” you should be able to solve this in under 60 seconds!
