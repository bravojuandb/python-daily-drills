"""
Write a program `guess_number()` that:

1. Picks a secret number (e.g. 7).
2. Asks the user to guess with input("Guess a number: ").
3. Converts the guess to an integer with int().
4. If the guess is correct â†’ print "Correct!".
5. If the guess is too low â†’ print "Too low!".
6. If the guess is too high â†’ print "Too high!".

âš¡ Task:
- Implement the function.
- Test it by guessing wrong once, then correct.

Be quick! ğŸš€
