You are given a list of numbers with duplicates:

nums = [2, 4, 2, 6, 4, 9, 6, 12, 9]

Task:
1. Use a **set comprehension** to extract only the unique values.
2. Only include numbers greater than 5.
3. Transform each number into its square.

Expected result â†’ {36, 81, 144}

Write this in one line using a set comprehension.
