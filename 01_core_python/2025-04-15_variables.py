Task: Parse Dates and Extract Weekdays

Real-World Relevance

Raw datasets often include timestamps or dates in inconsistent string formats. As a Data Engineer, you're frequently asked to **parse dates**, validate them, and extract useful components like weekdays, month names, or years â€” for analytics, time-series pipelines, or aggregation logic.

Your Task

Given a list of records with `event_name` and `event_date` as strings, write a script that:

1. Assigns each field to a variable
2. Parses the `event_date` string to a `datetime` object
3. Extracts the weekday name (e.g., `"Monday"`)
4. Stores the cleaned and enriched record in a new list
5. Skips records with invalid or unparsable dates
